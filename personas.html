            <h2 style = "font-weight: 300; font-size: 48px;">Context</h2>
            <p>
                My group and I were tasked with designing two different iterations for a single 
                interface and then determining which of the two was better for a given task. 
                <br></br>
                The task we chose as a metric was: "remove all of the items from the cart." While this metric 
                was simple, we felt that this function was extremely important to the experience of the interface.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <h2 style = "font-weight: 300; font-size: 48px;">Research and Design</h2>
            <!--  What precedent work is out there? Who is our audience? What do they want/think?  -->
            <p>
                In designing the two iterations, the main question we considered was "how do existing online shops 
                add and remove items?" We concluded that the most shops did the following or a combination of the two: 
                <br/>
            
            </p>
            <div style = "display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;align-items: flex-end; justify-content: space-around;">
                <img src = "abtesting-assets/Screen Shot 2022-12-09 at 2.22.21 AM.png" style = "height: 15rem;">
                <img src = "abtesting-assets/Screen Shot 2022-12-09 at 2.29.32 AM.png" style = "width: 18rem;">
            </div>
            <br/>
            <p>
                In the first example, items are added and subtracted solely from the item in the gallery. In the second
                example, the items can be added and removed from the cart, <b>in addition</b> to being able to be added 
                from the item card. As such, we chose to implement these two features in our two designs. 

                
                <br></br>
                The first example is advantageous in that users are able to make a visual connection, instead of a semantic connection, 
                between what they're adding and the actual item. The tradeoff, however, is that it requires more navigation to 
                actually remove the item, since users mus renavigate to the item in the gallery to remove it. In the second example, the 
                vice versa is often the case. 
                <br></br>
                After considering the tradeoffs between these two designs, we drew up these two designs: 
            </p>

            <div style = "display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;align-items: flex-end; justify-content: space-around; ">
                <img class = "persona-image" src = "abtesting-assets/Screen Shot 2022-12-09 at 2.42.59 AM.png" style = "width: 20rem;">
                <img class = "persona-image" src = "abtesting-assets/Screen Shot 2022-12-09 at 2.46.20 AM.png" style = "width: 20rem;">
               <!-- style = "width: 18rem;" -->
            </div>
            <figcaption style = "text-align: center;">Version A (left) and Version B (right)</figcaption>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Version A imlements cart editing through strictly the item cards and Version B implements
                card editing through both the card items and the cart itself. 
                <br></br>
            </p>
            <h2 style = "font-weight: 300; font-size: 48px;">User Testing</h2>
            <p>
                The next question we sought to answer was <strong>which version is better?</strong> In testing this 
                hypothesis, we used or metric task that required users to remove all of the items in the cart. Based on 
                this metric, we hypothsized that version b, the version where cart editing could be done through both the 
                item cards and the cart itself, would perform better. 
                <br></br>
                In testing this hypothesis, we had two users execute the task on each design. While users
                completed the task, we mapped their eye movements to see how efficiently they would complete the task. We then
                generated heat maps based on their eye movements, detecting the areas of the screen where they looked at most. Here's the 
                combined data for both users:  
                
            </p>
            <br/>
            <div style = "display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;align-items: flex-end; justify-content: space-around; ">
                <img class = "persona-image" src = "abtesting-assets/Final replay (versiona2).jpeg" style = "width: 21rem;">
                <img class = "persona-image" src = "abtesting-assets/Final replay (versionb1).jpeg" style = "width: 22rem;">
                <!-- style = "width: 18rem;" -->
            </div>
            <figcaption style = "text-align: center;">Eye-tracking data for 1 user (left: Version A, right: Version B)</figcaption>
            <br/>
            <p>
                In analyzing these results, we can clearly see that the number of data points, which is correlated to the 
                duration of time taken to complete the task, is significantly higher in version A. From this, we can conclude 
                that version B performs better when measured by efficiency.
            </p>

            <br></br>

            <h2 style = "font-weight: 300; font-size: 48px;">Conclusions</h2>
            <p>
                This project really allowed me to utilize my skills as a scientist! I really enjoyed the process
                of being able to form a hypothesis and use AB Testing to test that hypothesis; it's something that I really
                haven't gotten much experience with in the computer science world. Apart from this reflection, however, this 
                project was also really cool because of the eye-tracking technology we were able to use. 
                <br></br>
                Perhaps most importantly, however, is that I was able to see, first hand, the effects of good design 
                when usability is taken into consideration. Clearly, version A was designed with logic, but without the 
                usability considerations necessary to optimize the experience, but it was evident that 
                usability considerations had considerable effects in optimizing the user experience in version b. As such, 
                this project was paramount in enforcing the importance of usability-centered design.
